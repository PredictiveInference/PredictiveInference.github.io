<P>
The <a href="https://stat.iastate.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> at <a href="https://www.iastate.edu/">Iowa State University</a> will host a conference on predictive inference and its applications
on May 7 and 8, 2018, in Ames, Iowa.
</P>

<P>
Goals of the conference include raising awareness about the importance of predictive inference and its applications, 
showcasing research of current and emerging leaders in the field, 
and encouraging interactions and collaborations among a diverse collection of scientists with complementary skills and abilities.
The conference will also include a session in honor of Charles Roy Henderson, who was an Iowa State graduate, member of the United States 
National Academy of Sciences, and a pioneering developer of prediction methodology used in animal breeding and a wide range 
of other application areas.  The conference is made possible by a gift from David Harville, Emeritus Professor of Statistics at 
Iowa State University, and is co-sponsored by the 
  <a href="www.amstat.org">American Statistical Association</a> 
  <a href="http://community.amstat.org/slds/home">Section on Statistical Learning and Data Science</a>.
